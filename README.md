# Note-react-app
https://note-reminder-on-important.herokuapp.com/ Together with part 2 in my current course called fullstack open https://fullstackopen.com/ I got a deeper understanding about react. This app allows you to add and check-off any note. The user can choose to filter notes by the importance. Once an input is submitted it's send to the json file that is through axios communitacting to the browser.
