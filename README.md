# Note-react-app
https://note-reminder-on-important.herokuapp.com/   Together with part 2 in my current course called fullstack open https://fullstackopen.com/en/#course-contents I learned more about react. Apart from bein a simple note app it's build with react and constantly updated with their useStates. It's also filtering the favourites/important once from the complete notes.  The backend get's handled by the json file. Axios is handling the communication between server and browser (service/notes.js). In the end the default middleware helps to processes the data into a format that can be recognized by the other platform.
